This front-end project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Important note

This implementation has some issues with CORS that have yet to be sorted out for the POST, DELETE, and PUT queries 
(all GET queries are fine.)  As a temporary fix to run all queries successfully on your machine,
you can download and run this extension on Chrome: [Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi)

We hope to have a fix up and running by Thursday, but in a pinch, this will work for our demo.

## Setup

If you don't already have npm installed on your machine, make sure to do so.

Navigate to the project folder.  Install React and several other dependencies:

`npm install`

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

To get the back-end up and running, you'll also need to download and run the back-end repo.

## Other Available Scripts

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
